gameshelf is a fullstack web application inspired by Goodreads with a theme of video games.  gameshelf uses Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React/Redux on the frontend.

Upon a new user signing up, he/she will be provided with three default gameshelves with a status of "Played," "Currently Playing," or "Want to Play." The user is then able to create and delete additional gameshelves. Each game within the database has a show page that the user can view, add reviews, see other users' reviews, and edit or delete their own review.
